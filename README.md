### Tech Used
For this app I wrote and connected the MongoDB database and routes using:

node.js  
express.js  
sequelize  
Mongoose  

And tested these routes with:  
>Insomnia

## Installation

After cloning down the repo, be sure to install all node.js dependancies with the command `npm i` in the integrated terminal. 

Ensure your MongoDB database is running locally on your machine. To seed the database with example models, run `npm run seed` in the integrated terminal.



Start your local server by entering either `node server.js` or if you have nodemon, `nodemon server.js` in the terminal.
